Implement Redis queue for embedding processing

- Added Redis queue mechanism to handle embedding messages asynchronously
- Observed issue: queue remains empty, embeddings are not properly pushed into Redis
- Suspect bug in the API endpoint or data serialization pipeline preventing enqueueing
- Added basic logging to trace enqueue operations
- Further debugging needed to identify exact failure point in embedding submission flow
- goal 1...ensure embeddings are sent to redis
